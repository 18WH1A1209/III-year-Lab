# Experiment 2
## Aim of the Experiment
To implement data link layer framing such as

i.character count ii. character stuffing and iii.bit stuffing

### Step by step procedure of experiment
1.Assigning i=0 and count=0

2.Entering the number of frames

3.Entering the Data bits

4.Scan the data bits

5.If the bit is 1, then check for four consecutive 1,s

6.If so then stuff a bit 0 at that position 

7.Printing data bits after bit stuffing at the sender

8.Printing the data recieved and data after de-stuffing at the reciever
